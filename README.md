# Scroll Zoom

Scroll Zoom is a client-side camera modification for **Among Us** that enables adjustable zoom using the mouse scroll wheel.

The mod directly modifies the in-game camera, altering the visible area rendered to the player. It is intended for **modded environments, development, testing, recording, and private lobbies**.
